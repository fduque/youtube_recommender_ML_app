# youtube_recommender_ML_app

## A E2E project for creating a video recommender app based on YouTube videos.

## Project NOTES:
- As final project from course provided by Kagglemaster Mario Filho, the target of this project is to implement a bunch of shortcuts and best practices learned in his course.
- From data extraction to deploying model, the project uses an ensemble model (LightGBM and RandomForest) to predict which ytube video would be interesting based on three keywords ["machine+learning", "data+science", "kaggle"].

## Check below a high-level diagram of the project:
